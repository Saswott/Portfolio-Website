  <li style="color: #B48B7D;">Project 2: IOT Based Soil Moisture Sensor:</li>
        <P class="text-center">An IoT-based soil moisture sensor is an innovative system designed by our group to monitor soil moisture levels in real-time, making it a valuable tool for agricultural and environmental applications. The sensor measures the amount of water present in the soil, which is crucial for maintaining optimal growing conditions for crops and plants. By leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) technology, this system enables remote monitoring and automation, providing farmers and gardeners with real-time data on soil moisture, which can be accessed from smartphones, computers, or other connected devices.
          The soil moisture sensor typically consists of two probes that are inserted into the soil. These probes measure the volumetric water content by detecting the resistance between them; when the soil is dry, the resistance is higher, and when the soil is wet, the resistance decreases. The data collected by the sensor is then transmitted to a cloud-based server via an IoT-enabled microcontroller, such as an Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or ESP8266 module. From there, users can access and analyze the moisture levels through a web or mobile application.
          One of the key benefits of this system is its ability to automate irrigation based on real-time data. By setting thresholds for soil moisture, the system can automatically trigger irrigation when the soil becomes too dry and turn it off once the desired moisture level is reached. This ensures that plants receive the right amount of water at the right time, reducing water wastage and optimizing plant growth. Additionally, the system can send alerts to users if the soil moisture levels fall below or rise above certain thresholds, allowing for timely interventions.
          The IoT-based soil moisture sensor also promotes sustainable farming practices by enabling precision agriculture. It helps farmers conserve water, reduce the use of fertilizers, and minimize crop damage caused by overwatering or underwatering. Moreover, the data collected over time can provide valuable insights into soil health and plant water requirements, helping farmers make more informed decisions about irrigation and crop management. Overall, this system represents a smart, efficient, and eco-friendly approach to modern agriculture, enhancing productivity while conserving resources.</P>

    <li style="color: #B48B7D;">Project 3: Website For Laptop Buying Workplace Using EclipseID:</li>
      <P class="text-center">Our group desinged a website for buying and selling laptops, developed using Eclipse IDE, which help in designed to provide a comprehensive platform where users can easily browse, buy, sell, and manage laptops. This web application integrates various functionalities to enhance the user experience, making it an ideal solution for both individual buyers and sellers in a professional workplace setting.
        The core functionality of the website includes a user-friendly interface where users can register and log in to access personalized features. After logging in, users can browse an extensive catalog of laptops available for sale. Each laptop listing includes detailed information such as brand, model, specifications, price, and high-quality images to assist users in making informed decisions. Advanced search and filter options allow users to sort laptops based on parameters like price range, brand, or specifications, streamlining the shopping experience.
        For buyers, the website features a cart system where selected laptops can be added before proceeding to checkout. The cart displays a summary of the selected items, including their names, prices, and total cost, providing a transparent view of the purchase. Once ready, users can complete their purchase through a secure checkout process that supports multiple payment methods, ensuring a smooth and safe transaction.
        On the selling side, registered users can list their own laptops for sale by providing essential details such as laptop name, specifications, price, and a description. Sellers can also upload images to enhance their listings. The website allows sellers to manage their listings, view current offers, and track sales performance through a dedicated seller dashboard.
        Additional functionalities include user account management, where users can view their purchase history, track orders, and manage their profiles. The website also offers notifications and alerts related to order status, promotions, or new listings, keeping users informed and engaged.
        Developed using Eclipse IDE, the website benefits from robust backend support and integration with technologies like Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Eclipse IDE facilitates efficient coding, debugging, and testing, ensuring that the website operates smoothly and delivers a seamless user experience. Overall, the website serves as an efficient platform for buying, selling, and managing laptops, catering to the needs of both buyers and sellers while providing a professional and user-centric online marketplace.</P>
